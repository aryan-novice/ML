Spam Mail Prediction – Project Summary 
Developed a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (legitimate).
Utilized a public dataset containing 5,500+ labeled SMS messages.

Data preprocessing involved:
1.Converting messages to lowercase.
2.Removing English stop words.
3.Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical features.
4.Trained a Logistic Regression model on the processed data.

Achieved:
96.7% training accuracy
96.6% testing accuracy
The small difference between training and testing accuracy shows minimal overfitting and good generalization.
The system can be integrated into SMS/email platforms to automatically detect and filter out spam.

Future improvements may include trying other classifiers like:
1.Support Vector Machines (SVM)
2.Naive Bayes
3.Random Forest
4.Demonstrates effective use of text classification and natural language processing (NLP) in solving real-world problems.
